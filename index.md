### CPSC 120

* Lab 6
Lab 6, part 1, was a favorite of mine because it was the introduction of nested loops. Previously we had just used singular loops, but this allowed us to work with rows and columns in future projects. This lab led me to become interested in the operation of nested for loops and produce future codes I developed later on.

* Lab 10
Lab 10, part 3, was my favorite out of all the labs. The first reason the introduction of gifs stood out to me would be its importance within later labs, such as part 12 and other labs; it proved to be useful throughout the course. Another reason this was my favorite lab would be because it showed me a moving description of my work and code, which was visually compellingly to me.

* Lab 11
Lab 11, part 1, was another favorite lab project of mine because it was the introduction to classes. We had only touched on the specifics of classes, such as public and private information within them, but it was interesting to see how they worked and operated. This lab helped me realize the difference between public and private information. These differences would be that private information is seen but not edited, and public is changeable and accessible to view.
